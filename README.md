# Owen's n1-nvim 

## Install:
```
git clone -b owen-nvim git@github.com:AlgorexHealth/n1-nvim.git
./install.sh

## About:
This config uses VimPlug (by the notorius junegunn).
The config is simply a single init.vim file that contains everything.
Includes plugins for vim-terminal, nerdtree, and codium by default.

## Making changes:
To add plugins, open the ~/.config/nvim/init.vim file and add plugins. Be sure to run PlugInstall to run the installation.
To change colorscheme, modify the :colorscheme command in the init.vim file.
